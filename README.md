This chatbot recommends popular restaurants in Jeju Island based on data provided by Shinhan Card. 🏝️🍽️🍊

By classifying locations into hot places 🔥 and cool places ❄️, it suggests well-known and hidden gems depending on the user’s query and context.

The service is implemented using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technique and LLM (Large Language Models) to enhance recommendation accuracy. 🤖

🎉 ⭐ This project was recognized for its innovation and received an award in the 2024 Bigcontest Generative-AI Session ⭐ 🎉
